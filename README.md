# Project

### Project description
Our idea is a website that rounds up your purchases and donates excess amounts to charity. Suppose if you buy flowers and the amount for them will be 7897 tenge, you can turn on the rounding function on our website (for this, the choice will be rounded to tens, hundredths, etc.) to 7900 or 8000 tenge, and the extra amount that the user will pay go to different donations, a list of which will also be provided.

### Scope of the project
Honestly we can't predict how long will take development because we are not very goot at programming  but we hope that we will finish until the semester (at least a demo)

### Type of interface
We will do a website because knowledge of our team is more appropriate to make a site that a desktop application or mobile application

### Programming language and database
C# ASP.NET and MSsql it is main stack but maybe we will take another technologies
